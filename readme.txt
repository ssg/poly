Poly 
====
Poly was a commercial software I developed back in 1997 for PVC Window
Manufacturers in Turkey. The software allows you to select one of the
window layouts and provide metrics to calculate all the materials 
needed up to number of screws needed and the total cost. 

It runs on DOS and uses FatalVision so compiling it might not be a
straightforward task. FV sources could be found at 
http://github.com/ssg/xvision.

It still contains keydisk protection code.

OBJ files are for easter egg I provided with the software. It contains
typed text by me with realtime keystroke simulation along with some
images I drew.
