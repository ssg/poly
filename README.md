Poly 
====
Poly was a commercial software I developed back in 1997 for PVC Window
Manufacturers in Turkey. The software allowed you to select one of the
window layouts and provide metrics to calculate all the materials 
needed up to number of screws needed and the total cost.

It runs on DOS and uses [FatalVision](http://github.com/ssg/xvision), 
so, compiling it might not be a straightforward task.

It still contains keydisk protection code.

OBJ files are for [the easter egg](https://twitter.com/0ffffffffh/status/1304945186963939333?s=20&t=DZvIUE7ka4CPGBjT1GD9gg) 
I provided with the software. It contains typed text by me with realtime 
keystroke simulation along with some images I drew.
